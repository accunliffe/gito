## run common git commands slightly faster

right now the output on the console doesn't display correctly

typically a quick push means doing: 

```
git add .
git commit -m 'your commit message'
git push
```

I repeat these three steps frequently enough. 

with gito install globally you can just do:

```
gito 'your commit message'
```

be careful with those commits and pushes, because it's all going to happen fast now in one fell swoop.
